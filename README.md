#iFives

Currently waiting release to the iTunes Store.

iFives is an iOS app built in React Native with an [API](https://github,com/martymclaugh/ifive-api) built in Ruby on Rails.
## Tech Stack
* React Native(React, JSX)
* Javascript
* Ruby on Rails
* Twilio

iFives solves the problem of the unsatisfactory 'air five'. Users can send high fives to their contacts with the flick of a thumb.

Using native Push Notifications, if you receive a high five you will get an alert even if the app is closed. If a user doesn't have the app, Twilio sends the high five via sms, and invites you to join the app.
