#iFives

### Currently waiting release to the iTunes Store.

### iFives is an iOS app built in React Native with an [API](https://github.com/martymclaugh/ifive-api) built in Ruby on Rails.

### Note: If you clone this repo, you will need to run the build on an actual iOS device due to the fact that the simulator does not have a device token for push notifications. You also will not need to clone the API as the react-native app points to the hosted API. Until the actual iTunes release, all text messages and push notifications will be directed to the device running the application.

Please see: http://apple.co/2hwpToY on how to run iFives on an iOS Device.

## Tech Stack
* React Native(React, JSX)
* Javascript
* Ruby on Rails
* Twilio

iFives solves the problem of the unsatisfactory 'air five'. Users can send high fives to their contacts with the flick of a thumb.

Using native Push Notifications, if you receive a high five you will get an alert even if the app is closed. If a user doesn't have the app, Twilio sends the high five via sms, and invites you to join the app.
