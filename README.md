#iFives

### Currently waiting release to the iTunes Store.


iFives. The easiest way to send a high five.

Your friend just told an awesome joke? Give them a Five.
Your child got an A in class? Give them a Five.
It's your turn to buy a round of drinks? Give a round of Fives instead.
You destroyed that presentation at work? Give yourself a Five.
You can't pay your movers? Give them some Fives.
You can't reach across the table to high five? Give them a Five.
Someone just became the worlds best player in a video game? Give them a Five.
Someone said 'Slap me some skin?' Slap them some screen instead!
Just got a Five? Give them a Five.

With up high and down low, there's no being too slow if you have iFives!


### iFives is an iOS app built in React Native with an [API](https://github.com/martymclaugh/ifive-api) built in Ruby on Rails.

### Note: If you clone this repo, you will need to run the build on an actual iOS device due to the fact that the simulator does not have a device token for push notifications. You also will not need to clone the API as the react-native app points to the hosted API. Until the actual iTunes release, all text messages and push notifications will be directed to the device running the application.

Please see: http://apple.co/2hwpToY on how to run iFives on an iOS Device.

## Tech Stack
* React Native(React, JSX)
* Javascript
* Ruby on Rails
* Twilio

iFives solves the problem of the unsatisfactory 'air five'. Users can send high fives to their contacts with the flick of a thumb.

Using native Push Notifications, if you receive a high five you will get an alert even if the app is closed. If a user doesn't have the app, Twilio sends the high five via sms, and invites you to join the app.
